### `TabComponent` Technical Documentation

#### Overview
`TabComponent` is a Blazor component used for managing tabs in a web application. It allows users to add, remove, and select tabs easily, facilitating seamless navigation between different sections. Additionally, the component can set a default page (`DefaultPage`), which opens automatically upon the initial load.

#### File and Code Descriptions

##### 1. `TabService.cs`

**Responsibilities:**
- Manages tabs (adding, removing, setting the active tab).
- Sets and manages the default page (`DefaultPage`) URL.
- Listens for URL changes and updates the tab state accordingly.

**Key Code Sections:**

- `DefaultPage` property: Stores the default page URL and sets the initial active tab.
- `OnLocationChanged` method: Listens for URL changes and adds or activates appropriate tabs.
- `AddTab` method: Adds a new tab.
- `SetActiveTab` method: Sets the specified URL as the active tab.
- `RemoveTab` method: Removes a tab and updates the state as necessary.

##### 2. `TabComponent.razor.cs`

**Responsibilities:**
- Manages the display and user interactions with the tabs.
- Shares the default page URL with `TabService`.
- Handles tab selection and removal operations.

**Key Code Sections:**

- `OnInitialized` method: Sets up the default page settings and listens for changes in `TabService` when the component is first loaded.
- `SelectTab` method: Updates the active tab and navigates to the page when a tab is selected.
- `RemoveTab` method: Removes a tab and updates the active tab accordingly.

##### 3. `TabComponent.razor`

**HTML Structure:**
- Defines the layout of the tab component.
- Contains HTML and Blazor code for listing, selecting, and removing tabs.

**Key Code Sections:**

- Tabs loop: Uses `@foreach` to iterate over `TabService.Tabs`, creating tab headers and close buttons.
- Tab selection: Manages tab clicks with `@onclick="() => SelectTab(tab.Url)"`.
- Tab removal: Handles tab closing with `@onclick="() => RemoveTab(tab)"`.

##### 4. `tab-component.css`

**Style Definitions:**
- Defines the styling of the tab component.
- Includes CSS classes for active and inactive tab states.

**Key Code Sections:**

- `.tabs`: Ensures horizontal alignment of tabs.
- `.tab`: Defines the styling for tab headers.
- `.tab.active`: Styles the active tab.
- `.tab .close`: Styles the close button.

##### 5. `_Layout.cshtml`

**HTML and CSS Inclusion:**
- Defines the overall layout of the Blazor application.
- Includes the necessary CSS files for `TabComponent`.

**Key Code Sections:**

- `<link href="css/tab-component.css" rel="stylesheet" />`: Includes the `tab-component.css` file.

##### 6. `Program.cs`

**Service Registration:**
- Registers the necessary services for the Blazor application.
- Adds `TabService` to the DI container.

**Key Code Sections:**

- `builder.Services.AddScoped<TabService>();`: Registers `TabService` as a scoped service in the DI container.

#### Workflow

1. **Component Initialization:**
   - When the `TabComponent` is loaded, the `OnInitialized` method runs.
   - The default page (`DefaultPage`) is set via `TabService`.
   - A tab for the default page is added and set as active.

2. **Tab Management:**
   - When a user clicks on a tab, the `SelectTab` method runs.
   - The clicked tab is set as the active tab and navigates to the related page.
   - When a user closes a tab, the `RemoveTab` method runs, removing the tab from the list.

3. **URL Changes:**
   - The `TabService` class listens for URL changes (`OnLocationChanged`).
   - When the URL changes, it adds or sets the appropriate tab as active.

#### Summary
`TabComponent` is a powerful component for dynamic tab management in Blazor applications. With `TabService`, tabs can be added, removed, and managed efficiently. Page navigation is handled using `NavigationManager`. Style definitions are located in the `tab-component.css` file, and the overall structure is defined in `_Layout.cshtml`. This component enhances the user experience by enabling quick and easy transitions between tabs.
